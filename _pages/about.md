Hi! Iâ€™m Mengyuan Liu, a Align MSCS student at the Northeastern University (NEU) in the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) and Vice President of [Multimedia Information Group (MIG) Research Lab](https://miglab.sites.northeastern.edu/).  

Before I joined Khoury College, I received my MPA also from the NEU [College of Social Sciences and Humanities](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/) in 2021, and my B.A. at the Nankai University (NKU) [Zhou Enlai School of Government](https://zsg.nankai.edu.cn/) in 2019.
