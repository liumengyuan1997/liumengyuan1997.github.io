Details:  

Led full-stack development projects at [GBCS Group](https://www.gbcsgroup.com/), enhancing user experience with Next.js and React, implementing robust authentication systems, integrating the Client Onboarding System with the Main System Backend, streamlining platforms with automated CI/CD pipelines, and coordinating cross-functional teams for successful Azure deployments within an Agile framework.

Implementation Spotlights:

* Implement functions with Next.js, Mantine, and React hooks, ensuring a fluid and engaging user experience.

* Implement robust authentication and authorization systems, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) with Node2FA and secure password hashing using bcrypt.

* Enhanced Backend Security: Applied secure coding practices in NodeJS by utilizing the validator library for input sanitization, implementing rate limiting to mitigate DDOS attacks with rate-limiter-flexible, and ensuring secure handling of passwords through salting and hashing.

* Designed and implemented a data transfer system for client data between the Client Onboarding System and Main System Backend, utilizing Django ORM and database-level solutions to ensure data integrity and compatibility.

* Developed and executed comprehensive API testing for the Main System Backend using Postman, including endpoints that require file uploads.

* Consolidate three applications into a unified platform and developed a robust CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.

* Facilitate front-end and back-end coordination across time zones for smooth Azure deployments.

* Utilize the Agile methodology in the development to ensure flexibility and responsive to evolving requirements. -->
