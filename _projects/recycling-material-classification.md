excerpt: "This project presents an automated system for classifying recyclable materials into five categories: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, and plastic, using deep learning and computer vision. We developed and evaluated three models: a custom CNN, a ResNet18-based model utilizing transfer learning, and a combined architecture that fuses features from both RGB and luminance channels. Trained on publicly available datasets, the final combined model achieved 96.28% accuracy on a separate test set. The model was also deployed in a real-time webcam application for recycling material classification. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning and multimodal feature fusion significantly enhance classification accuracy and generalization, supporting real-world deployment of intelligent recycling systems."
