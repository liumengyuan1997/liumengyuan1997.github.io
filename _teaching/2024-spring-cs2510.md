excerpt: "<i>Undergraduate course, Teaching Assistant</i><br/>
CS2510 centers on examining object-oriented programming and associated algorithms using more complex data structures. Discusses nested structures and nonlinear structures including hash tables, trees, and graphs. Emphasizes abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, recursion, and object-oriented design patterns. Applies these ideas to sample applications that illustrate the breadth of computer science."
